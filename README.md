When I enrolled for this course, I was expecting a class where we discussed the intersection of expressing history, sociology, and other fields through digital media, but it became more than that. Throughout the semester, I have realized how multifaceted Digital Humanities is, and the many different avenues one can take with a simple piece of data. This semester taught me to approach data and projects more creatively and meaningfully. Therefore, I have now learned to think more critically about history, the themes we can find, and how they can be preserved and expressed through different mediums. The workshops provided me with a lens outside of class, combining fields like board games and computer science or technology creation with communication. The assignment on The Umpire allowed me to look at data critically, collecting information that might go unnoticed. Lastly, through the final project in the EC, we went beyond just reflecting on data and created our visual representation. In the end, I now realize the many themes that intersect through digital humanities, like critical thinking, technology, creativity, communication, and reflection.


## Themes and Resources
There are many recurring themes that can be taken from readings, videos, and discussions we have had in class. For instance, one theme is the intersection of data and how these can be applied to new technologies. In her lecture Slowing Down Digital Humanities Practice, Kim Christen discusses how we can form pieces of knowledge through new technological mediums. That theme is explored in the workshop I took about board games and how we have come to create algorithms that beat them. Even through our Printing in Prisons assignment, we used many different data collection forms and digital expression. Through my essay on the Canaries, I had to collect data using Excel. I had to find ways of using digital databases and research and then put it all together through technologies like Adobe and Canva. Another key theme is using humanistic approaches like storytelling in conjunction with more technological and straightforward methods like data to preserve information. Alex Gil discusses this theme in his lecture on Digital Humanities. Through the EC project, we created a physical item that reflects the data and combines the human touch with technological resources. Lastly, one of the main takeaways I noticed throughout the class was how hands-on we were as students in making and having creative freedom. Gil also mentions in his lecture that students can have skills that digital humanities experts might not have; however, they need to be nurtured and practiced. Therefore, this class allowed us to reflect and think critically about our ideas and projects. 


## Workshops
The workshops provided much insight into how Digital Humanities can be utilized in areas outside the classroom. For example, the first workshop I attended was on Meshtastic, a tool that can be used to communicate without using networks, making it untraceable. The instructor explained how it can be used to pursue conversations with more freedom of speech and expression, a theme we discussed in class. The other workshop, which was on campus instead, discussed how board games can be connected to computer science. The workshop host explained how rolling a die is like a random number generator coding or how the rulebook is the equivalent of a program code. Through this class and these workshops, I was able to form even more ways to connect digital forms to games we might play every day and how we form algorithms and reflect on data in our heads without even knowing it.

## Projects
The projects that we did in class, Printing in Prisons and the EC assignment, allowed me to use what I had been learning through readings, lectures, and the workshops outside of class and apply it to my work. The Canaries in Eastern State essay was a way to express my interest in animals and the significance of a theme like animal care and hobbies for incarcerated men. I thought about expressing the data I had found and my perspective in many creative ways. Ultimately, I decided to use the digital tool Canva as it allowed for more interaction and placement of the images and texts. After utilizing that to create the draft, I could transport it onto GitHub and learn new skills on website additions and interactions. Here, I could see the intersection of history, preservation, and technology while managing my perspective and expression.

The Education Commons was a place on campus I had never visited. Therefore, getting to do a project there allowed me to discover the amount of resources we have on campus that I had yet to utilize. I wanted my team and me to challenge ourselves and use the laser cutter to highlight a pertinent topic in The Umpire. Throughout the experience, we learned the challenges of visually and physically implementing data. In addition, we could utilize the concepts we had learned in our visit to Van Pelt where we looked at how people were archiving data, taking images, and organizing them. When looking at the data on religion, we had to collect, manage, and express it through a digital and 3D medium.

## Patterns 
Many patterns emerged throughout the semester. For instance, as mentioned previously, there are applications of creativity and expression through data while preserving it through digital mediums like GitHub and essay writing or coding. In addition, storytelling was personally emphasized throughout the class as all data has significance, and all projects tell narratives. Initially, these themes came from the readings, but then I could see their precise applications in person. Through our many field trips and hands-on work, I could think critically about the themes and began expanding my personal growth throughout the course.

## Reflection
Furthermore, as I mentioned before, digital humanities was just a combination of technology and humanities at the start. However, as time went on, that view expanded. Digital humanities is about preserving data and reiterating the importance of self-expression and the narratives behind our projects and data. Therefore, these ideas can be analyzed by oneself and by everyone who interacts with them, creating a space for discussion and a reminder of data and its history in the field of humanities. As for the projects and work, I wish I had more time to work in Education Commons as that project felt rushed. I would've loved to make something more complex with the laser cutter. However, with the time given and the assignments done, I uncovered essential themes in The Umpire. Ultimately, this course has allowed me to grow personally and academically, giving me more inspiration and creativity for future projects.
