After taking this course, I want to take three significant steps to continue my future learning. They all involve expanding my academic knowledge and allowing me to pursue more creative fields.


## Product Design
An area of expertise that has always interested me was Product Design. However, my major classes that allowed this type of work were difficult to fit into my schedule. The Digital Humanities minor and this course encouraged me to continue working and pursuing that passion. For instance, we worked hands-on with laser cutter machines through the Education Commons project. In addition, the idea of building something physical that provides a product to someone, in this case, a representation of data, is something I want to pursue. Through this course, I realized that not only do I want to help build and construct products, but I want them to be meaningful and tell narratives that might go otherwise untold, forming a stronger connection with my humanities-oriented major of PPE. 


## Courses and Skills
Another step I want to take is to continue taking advantage of the resources I have on campus that will allow me to further venture into my passion for Product Design and Digital Humanities. Before this class, I was unsure if I would pursue the minor entirely, but now I am certain. I am almost done with the digital humanities minor, but I want to continue looking at courses like DSGN 1070: Graphic Design – Creative Technologies. I can expand my humanities interests while implementing them in my projects through courses like this. I would like to potentially start a project where I can master graphic design and find creative ways to archive important historical moments for my home country of Nicaragua. 


## Personal Project
My last step is to continue to grow my current personal project. During the pandemic, I worked on creating vinyl stickers with everyday sayings and cultural references to Nicaragua. I wanted to combine my interests in culture and humanities from my home while also getting to implement the digital skills I have acquired. However, I haven’t had enough time, opportunity, and skills to continue at Penn. Now, through my learning in this class, I want to restart this venture and continue working on it using the resources demonstrated to me through our field trips, class and the new skills I have acquired.

## Conclusion
In the end, the three steps I want to take post-class reflect that I have regained a passion for combining my interests in modern-day digital technologies through a meaningful perspective on history and significant areas in the humanities. Through a combination of these two, I will continue to foster what I learned in this course and through my minor while also getting to work on my own personal interests.
